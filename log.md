# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded my old 100-days-of-code fork, and deleted it! Fresh start!

**Thoughts:** I really am going to try to follow the rules this time. Every day, at least one hour working on a project. I will of course still be doing tutorials, but I will NOT count that as time. This will be challenging, but I am committed! I will tweet every day and encourage at least two people every day!

### Day 2: January 2nd, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Udemy Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp & The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery.

**Thoughts:** Ok so yeah going to use time for these courses. Well over two hours spent. Maybe when I have a job as a dev I can devote an hour of pure coding after work. For now, I need to learn learn learn! And I did do a good bit of code learning call, apply and bind for 'this' keyword.

### Day 3: January 3rd, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress:** Registered professional domain name. Worked on 'this' keyword challenges in AWDB.

**Thoughts:** I registered a domain name to use for my portfolio page and a site to post my projects. I still need a web host. Also worked on 'this' keyword challenges. Got two down! I'm posting that here!
